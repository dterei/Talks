# David Terei's Blog

This repo consists of my various blog posts. My usual technique is to write
them in markdown and then use the excelent pandoc tool to convert them to HTML
for posting.

My blog is currently located [here][http://dterei.blogspot.com/]. Some of these
posts may have been written for other blogs but I'll usually cross post to my
blog as well.
